## Project Details

The Excel Clone project is a web-based application that replicates Microsoft Excel functionalities using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Completed in March 2023, it includes features like text formatting, cell range selection, formula bar, color picker, text alignment, basic arithmetic operations, and multiple sheet creation. The project provides users with a user-friendly interface for creating and managing spreadsheets, and the code is available on GitHub.

## Features

**Feature 1: Text Formatting**
You can perform text formatting on single cells as well as a range of cells. Text formatting options include bold, italic, underline, font-size, and font-style.

**Feature 2: Cell Range Selection**
For selecting a cell range, press the 'Ctrl' key and then select the starting cell and ending cell.

**Feature 3: Unselect**
To deselect cells, hold the 'Ctrl' key and click any other location, then release the 'Ctrl' key and select any other cell.

**Feature 4: Formula Bar**
The project utilizes a graph data structure to implement the Excel formula bar. You can also type cell addresses directly in the address bar.

**Feature 5: Color Picker**
A color picker is added for formatting cell content and cell background with a selected color.

**Feature 6: Text Alignment**
Align text as per options - left, center, and right.

**Feature 7: Formula Bar**
Perform basic arithmetic operations in the formula bar. All operators and operands must be space-separated (e.g., A1 + A2 - 2 * A3 + A4). There are four implemented functions as of now:

- `= SUM(Exp1, Exp2)`
- `= SUB(Exp1, Exp2)`
- `= DIV(Exp1, Exp2)`
- `= MUL(Exp1, Exp2)`

**Feature 8: Sheet Creation**
Add more sheets by clicking the "Add Sheets" button in the bottom left corner.

Overall, the Excel Clone project provides users with a user-friendly interface for creating and managing spreadsheets. The project code is available on GitHub.
